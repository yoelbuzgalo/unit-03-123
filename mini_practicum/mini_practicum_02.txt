Unit 02 Mini-Practicum

The goal of these "mini-practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gage your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in this folder along with these
instructions.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. Each of the numbered 
problems below is weighted equally. 


1. Create a new Python module in a file named "practice.py" and define a 
function named "convert_height." The function should prompt the user to enter 
their height in inches, and then print the height back to the user in feet and
inches.

  a. Your function needs only handle whole numbers of inches, i.e. the user 
     will not enter fractional inches as floating-point numbers.

  b. You should produce output that matches the example below as closely as 
     possible, including the use of ' to indicate feet, and " to indicate 
     inches in the output.

  c. Example output:

     Enter your height in inches: 71
     You are 5' 11" tall

  d. Define a main function and use it to call your function.


2. In the practice.py module, define a new function named "before" that 
   declares a parameter for a letter of the alphabet. The function should print 
   the letter and the 3 preceding letters in the alphabet. You may assume that
   the letter is "d" or later in the alphabet. 

   Example output if the function is called with "X":
   X
   W
   V
   U

   Call your function from main.
